# Project 2 - Investigate Titanic Dataset

The sinking of the RMS Titanic occurred on the night of 14 April through to the morning of 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.

In this project, we will investigate a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger list to determine which features(age, gender, socio-economic status, etc.) help to predict whether someone survived or died.
